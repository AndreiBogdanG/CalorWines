  fullDescription: `It displays a delicate, luminous peach-pink hue that immediately catches the eye. On the nose, it unfolds with a fresh, lively, and generous aromatic profile, offering well-defined fruity notes of raspberry, white blossoms, wild strawberries, and crisp red apples. The intensity is above average, yet beautifully balanced, expressing a charming and approachable character.<br><br>

On the palate, it is light and fruit-driven, with vibrant hints of pink grapefruit and pomegranate adding an appealing twist. The finish is tonic, refreshing, and pleasantly crisp, leaving a clean and invigorating impression. An easy-drinking, friendly wine that captivates through its expressive and intense aromas.`,
