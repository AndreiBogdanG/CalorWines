The longer ripening period in these parcels allows the grapes to develop structure and complex aromatic nuances. The wine is pressed, clarified, and fermented at low temperatures to preserve the primary floral and fruity aromas, after which it undergoes 3 months of barrique aging, allowing the integration of the polyphenols typical of this variety, resulting in a body of exemplary finesse.

A wine that never goes unnoticed, is never left uncommented, and inevitably lingers in memory.<br><br>
Although it drinks easily, it is not a simple wine, as its friendly roundness—dominated by dried plums, cherries, and black sour cherries—is merely a “setting” for sensations of truffles and cocoa, slightly intoxicated by a drop of fresh blood, immersed in seductive oak aromas.
